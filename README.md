# modbus_poller
 A polling engine built around programability and having an interface for setting up new polling devices and tags through a MQTT Sparkplug Interface.\
 Implements my concept for a new standard called SparkPoll which is meant to be a away to define tag polling routines through a structure similar to a Sparplug payload.\
 The goal is for this to be a demo of how SparkPoll can be implemented to create a standardized interface for polling engines, which are a backbone of industrial internet of things connectivity.\
